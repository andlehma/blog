<p>God dammit, I fell down the /r/unixporn rabbit hole again.</p>
<p>My biggest personal flaw is that I&#39;m never satisfied. Though I really hate any &quot;personality test&quot; (read: Myers-Briggs), I do identify with the description of The Enneagram Institute&#39;s <a href="https://www.enneagraminstitute.com/type-7">Type Seven</a>, aka &quot;The Enthusiast.&quot; I am the type of person who must know everything about a topic before I can make a decision or form an opinion. I can&#39;t just go to the store and buy a pair of headphones, I first have to go to /r/headphones, read all of the guides, and learn about audio engineering. I wanted to buy my parents a new vaccuum cleaner for Christmas, and I quickly found myself hours into watching vaccuum reviews on Youtube (<a href="https://youtu.be/1uIos2Lulx8">surprisingly entertaining</a>). This is not a joke. I need help.</p>
<p>Side note: I do think Reddit makes this problem worse, since there is a subreddit for everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/4ZK8Z8hulFg">Relevant ProZD video</a></p>
<p>I recently bought a new laptop. Luckily there wasn&#39;t too much research to do since my budget was somewhat tight, and I already know I like Thinkpads. I ended up with a maxed out T480 with a little cosmetic damage. I needed to make sure I got a laptop with a thunderbolt 3 port to work with my dock (this damn dock will come up later). I also need a reasonable amount of performance since I use Angular for work and the compiler uses Google&#39;s &quot;make it run fast by giving it all the RAM&quot; technique.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t distrohop anymore. I&#39;m too used to Arch. I do hop desktop environments and window managers. There is a spectrum of Unix GUIs, spanning from &quot;works out of the box, but bloated&quot; to &quot;lightweight, requires lots of configuration to be usable.&quot; I first installed Gnome, which is on the former end of the spectrum. I like Gnome. I should just keep using Gnome. Install <a href="https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme">arc-theme</a> and <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1160/dash-to-panel/">dash-to-panel</a>, and I&#39;m set. I could easily be productive with a setup like that.</p>
<p>But of course, I&#39;m never satisfied. I love <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a> and have used it for years. Of course, i3 is at the other end of that spectrum. Luckily, because I have used i3 before, I can just port my old dotfiles over and have a working config. That&#39;s exactly what I did, and it worked great!</p>
<p>Unfortuately, that was just too easy. I was experiencing some performance problems with <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/compton-tryone-git/">Compton</a> and transparent blurring. I was able to get decent performance by disabling blurring, and great performance by just not using a compositor. But not using a compositor bothered me becuase now transparency doesn&#39;t work. Then I thought &quot;this is stupid, this is why Wayland exists. So that I don&#39;t need a separate compositor.&quot; Oh oh. Down the rabbit hole we go.</p>
<p><a href="Sway">https://swaywm.org/</a> is billed as a &quot;drop-in replacement for i3&quot; which runs on Wayland. <code>sudo pacman -S sway</code> and we&#39;re off to the races. Except trying to log in from GDM just kicked me back out to the login screen. Looking through the logs, I found out that the problem was with something called &quot;evdi&quot;. Huh, that sounded familiar. It turns out evdi is a kernel module for managing screens which is required by DisplayLink docks. I had installed it to get my dock working and it worked amazingly in i3 and Gnome (even under Wayland, weirdly). But sway doesn&#39;t like it. Specifically, wlroots (the set of modules made by the sway guys, on top of which sway is built) doesn&#39;t like it. I make this distinction a) to illustrate the rabbit-holiness of this situation and b) because the sway devs made it <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/4176">very clear</a>.</p>
<p>So then I had options. I spent all day today trying each one out. Sway works if I unplug my monitors from my dock. But I like my monitors. I tried to trick myself into believing that I would be more productive with a single monitor, and to just use the laptop built-in display. This almost worked. I am now unsure and will probably go back and forth on it for a while. <a href="https://hackernoon.com/why-i-stopped-using-multiple-monitors-bfd87efa2e5b">idk</a>. For now, I like my monitors. But while I was working with sway and a single monitor, I discovered <a href="https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar">waybar</a> which I love more than i3bar or polybar. And of course it only runs on sway. So then I was back in i3 trying to get compositing to work and hating my polybar. I did finally get compositing working with reasonable performance, using <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xcompmgr">xcompmgr</a>. Did you know that Compton was actually replaced by a newer fork called Picom? And that Compton is a fork of xcompmgr-dana, which in turn is a fork of xcompmgr? I know that now. I wish I didn&#39;t know that.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not even going to pretend that I did all of this in an effort to be productive. I am well aware that I could have written hundreds of lines of code in the time I spent doing this. My setup was just fine before. I do kind of enjoy this stuff, though I wish I didn&#39;t. Two parts of my brain are competing. Part of me just wants to write software using my computer, and not care about window managers or compositing or whatever. I think of all the programmers who I look up to; Rich Hickey, Dan Abramov, Bjarne Stroustrup. There&#39;s no way they spend this long messing with their system configuration. I view the time I spent on ricing my desktop in the same way I view time I spend watching Youtube or scrolling Reddit. Unfortunately, it&#39;s somehow even more addictive, and actively makes me even less productive.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#39;m going to have a dotfiles repo to share soon. You&#39;re welcome to look at it and use any and all of it. But I&#39;m mostly putting it up for myself, in the hopes that next time I get a new computer, I spend just a little less time writing dotfiles and a little more time writing code.</p>
